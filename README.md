# Connect-acts-from-external-sources-with-local-acts-of-the-company
Development of a recommender system that allows us to connect acts from external sources with local acts of the company, which are potentially subject to change.

$\text{Abstract}$

In this work, our main task is to find the internal acts of the company, which are potentially subject to change when there has been a change in external acts.

We divided the work into two parts: the first is to find documents by similarity using sapcy, transformers and other models and compared with the models that were used before. The second part, among those documents to which the potential change belongs, compare paragraph by paragraph and recommend exactly the potential paragraphs.

In the last stages, we talked about future plans using deep learning for the classification task.
